PHILOSOPHY
==========

Always present the appearance of a working, functioning system.
Be kind and polite to all whenever possible, conditions permitting.
Readable Perl source code for clarity, honesty, and ease of use.

Make reasonable effort to support every browser.
Do what the user wants; Don't ask or demand of the user.
Try to make user comfortable; Do not bother user with trivia.

Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
Whenever you find yourself on the side of majority, pause and reflect.
You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.

PHILOSOPHY
==========

Always present the appearance of a working, functioning system.

Use fallbacks and redundancy to replace downtime with degraded service.

Be kind and polite to all whenever possible, conditions permitting.

Readable Perl source code for clarity, honesty, and ease of use.


Make reasonable effort to support every browser and scenario.

Do what the client wants, and avoid asking or demanding of the user.

Try to make user comfortable, and avoid distracting with trivia.


Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

Whenever you find yourself on the side of majority, pause and reflect.

You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.


Avoid unreliable ways of doing things, like storing files in database.

Make up for user-agent deficiencies by adding accomodations.
